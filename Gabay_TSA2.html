                CLASS SUSPENSIONS AND SHIFTING DUE TO HEAT INDEX
            </h2>
            <p>
                4 April 2024 - In light of the high heat index experienced in different parts of the country,
                the Department of Education (DepEd) reiterates the provisions of Department Order 037 issued in 2022, 
                which provides guidelines on the cancellation or suspension of classes and work in schools in the event
                of natural disasters, power outages/power interruptions, and other calamities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, DepEd has given the school heads the authority and direction to suspend the conduct of in-person classes
                and shift to alternative delivery modes (ADM) in cases of extreme heat and other calamities that may compromise the health
                and safety of learners, teachers, and non-teaching personnel. This measure was the subject of OASOPS No. 2023-077 issued last 
                20 April 2023, and OUCT and OUOPS Memorandum dated 28 Febuary 2023 (Implementation of Alternative Delivery Mode (ADM) in All Public
                Elementary and Seconday Schools). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given that DepEd supervises more than 47,000 schools nationwide, it is in the best interest of the learning
                community to have localized assessments for timely response and interventions to ensure the welfare of learners and personnel.
